[INFO] Compiling 6 source files with javac [debug target 1.8] to target\test-classes
[WARNING] bootstrap class path is not set in conjunction with -source 8
  not setting the bootstrap class path may lead to class files that cannot run on JDK 8
    --release 8 is recommended instead of -source 8 -target 1.8 because it sets the bootstrap class path automatically
[WARNING] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
[WARNING] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
[WARNING] To suppress warnings about obsolete options, use -Xlint:-options.

WARNING: Unable to find version of CDP to use for 135.0.7049.116. You may need to include a dependency on a specific version of the CDP using something similar to `org.seleniumhq.selenium:selenium-devtools-v86:4.25.0` where the version ("v86") matches the version of the chromium-based browser you're using and the version number of the artifact is the same as Selenium's.
